This directory contains some of the old demos which were supplied
with Mesa-2.6. Almost all of these old demos were taken from the
code in the "book" directory on the old Mesa distribution. The
book itself, and hence the examples, have been updated to use
the GLUT library as opposed to the AUX library, thus the examples
here do not reflect those found in the current book directory. Programs
which used the AUX library to render shapes such as consed, spheres and
teapots do not run under Mesa 3.0 and can be found in the Aux directory.

The file "generic.m" contains code for generating a simple application
programaticaly with a single window in which the bitmap generated by
Mesa is displayed. It is heavily based on the original code written
by Pascal Thibaudeau (pascal@galileo.slip.u-bordeaux.fr) for his NeXTStep
Mesa port. The code takes the window size from two global variables
called gl_width and gl_height which are declared in the individual
examples. A function "render_image" is also provided by each example which
replaces the "main" or the original code. This function simply calls
"init, "reshape" and "display" to generate the bitmap when it is called
from generic.m to render the image. A piece of code such as "nurbs.c"
shows how this code works as opposed to the original code from the books
directory.

These examples do not work under Windows.
