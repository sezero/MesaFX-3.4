1. Introduction
---------------

This is the README file for the NeXT version of the Mesa library.
The file consists of information specific to the NeXT version of Mesa.
For more general information please read the README file in the main Mesa
directory.

2. Whats new?
-------------

See the general Mesa README for all the new items in Mesa-2.0.  This
section will only discuss those items which are specific to the NeXT.

	0.4 Release
	=========
	- New demos from the book directory
	- old nextdemoX removed

	0.3 Release
	=========
	- Mesa-2.0 is fixed

	0.2 Release
	=========
	- Some tk functions are now supported.
	- minor bugs are corrected.

	0.1 Release
	=========
	- Off-Screen rendering buffer is read by NXBitmapImageRep function.
	- 32bpp is directly supported.
	- WIDTH and HEIGHT are staticly defined.
	- The window style is NX_TITLEDSTYLE.
	- NeXT demos are straightforward ports of some book/ files.


3. The Distribution
-------------------

NeXT Mesa is distributed in one form.  This should make it easier to only
download what you need. The package is as follows:

	Mesa-2.0.tar.gz

This release contains the complete source to Mesa for the NeXT

4. Documentation
----------------

There is a Mesa WWW page:  http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html

There is a general WWW page related to OpenGL under NeXTSTEP:
http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/user/tsengel/

5. Compiling Mesa
----------------

In order to compile NeXT Mesa you need the following items:

	NEXTSTEP Developper Kit Release 3.3
	NeXT Mesa-2.0 (source)

The project  files included with the NeXT Mesa source should work
fine.  The only things you may need to update are the access paths.
Simply typing "make next" should compile Mesa and a number of NeXT demo
programs found in the NeXT/ directory. This was tested on a i386,m68k running
NEXTSTEP 3.3.

6. Test suite
-------------

The NeXT version of Mesa does not pass many of the tests in the
demos or samples suites.  This is primarily due to dependencies in the
suites on the size of particular X fonts, and other X related features.  We
will be working on developping a more general NeXT suite for Mesa under
the NeXT, but for now, you will not be able to pass many of the tests.
It is, however, much better than the alpha release!


6. NeXT Mesa Mailing List
