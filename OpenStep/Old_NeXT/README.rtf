\b 1. Introduction
\b0 \
\
This is the README file for the NeXT version of the
\i  Mesa
\i0  library.  \
The file consists of information specific to the NeXT version of
\i  Mesa
\i0 .\
For more general information please read the README file in the main
\i  Mesa
\i0 \
directory.\
\

\b 2. Whats new?
\b0 \
\
See the general
\i  Mesa
\i0  README for all new items in Mesa-2.0.  This\
section will only discuss those items which are specific to the NeXT.\
\

\gray56\fc2\cf2 0.4 Release
\gray0\fc0\cf0 \
	=========\
	- New demos from the book directory.\
	- old nextdemoX removed.\
\

\gray56\fc2\cf2 0.3 Release
\gray0\fc0\cf0 \
        =========\
	- Mesa-2.0 is fixed.\
\

\gray56\fc2\cf2 0.2 Release
\gray0\fc0\cf0 \
	=========\
	- Some tk functions are now supported.\
	- minor bugs are corrected.\
\

\gray56\fc2\cf2 0.1 Release
\gray0\fc0\cf0 \
	=========\
	- Off-Screen rendering buffer is read by
\f1  NXBitmapImageRep
\f0  function.\
	- 32bpp is directly supported.\
	- WIDTH and HEIGHT are staticly defined.\
	- The window style is
\f1  NX_TITLEDSTYLE
\f0 .\
	- NeXT demos are straightforward ports of some book/ files.\
	\

\b 3. The Distribution
\b0 \
\
NeXT
\i  Mesa
\i0  is distributed in one form.  This should make it easier to \
download only what you need. The package is as follows:\
\

\f1 Mesa-2.0.tar.gz
\f0 \
\
This release contains the complete source to
\i  Mesa
\i0  for the NeXT\
\

\b 4. Documentation
\b0 \
\
The
\i  Mesa
\i0  WWW page is :
\gray75\fc3\cf3 http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html
\gray0\fc0\cf0 \
\
There is also a general WWW page related to OpenGL under NeXTSTEP:\

\gray75\fc3\cf3 http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/user/tsengel/
\gray0\fc0\cf0 \
\

\b 5. Compiling Mesa
\b0 \
\
In order to compile NeXT
\i Mesa
\i0  you need the following items:\
\
	NEXTSTEP Developper Kit Release 3.3\
	NeXT Mesa-2.0 (source)\
\
The project files included with the NeXT
\i  Mesa
\i0  source should work \
fine. The only things you may need to update are the access paths.\
Simply typing "make next" should compile Mesa and a number of NeXT demo\
programs found in the NeXT/ directory. This was tested on a i386,m68k running \
NEXTSTEP 3.3. \
\

\b 6. Test suite
\b0 \
\
The NeXT version of
\i Mesa
\i0  does not pass many of the tests in the\
demos or samples suites.  This is primarily due to dependencies in the \
suites on the size of particular X fonts, and other X related features.  We\
will be working on developping a more general NeXT suite for
\i  Mesa
\i0  under the\
NeXT, but for now, you will not be able to pass many of the tests.  \
It is, however, much better than the alpha release!\
\
\

\i  Mesa
\i0  Mailing List, please send the following message to the address listproc@iqm.unicamp.br\
