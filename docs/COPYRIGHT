                        Mesa Copyright Information


The Mesa distribution consists of several components.  Different copyrights
apply to different components.  For example, GLUT is copyrighted by Mark
Kilgard, some demo programs are copyrighted by SGI, some of the Mesa
device drivers are copyrighted by the respective authors.

Through version 3.0, the core Mesa library was been distributed under the
GNU Library General Public License.

In Mesa 3.1 (and later) the core library instead uses the XFree86 copyright.
The copyright was being changed so that Mesa could be integrated into the
XFree86 X server in order to support 3D hardware acceleration.  Mesa will
still also be supported as a stand-alone library.

If you have contributed code to Mesa in the past and don't want your
code included in the non-GNU LGPL version please contact Brian to
have your code removed.




Common questions about the copyright change
-------------------------------------------

Q1. Why was the copyright changed?

A1. Mesa is being integrated with XFree86 (the free X server for Linux
and other Unix-like operating systems) in order to better support
3D hardware on Linux.  All code used in XFree86 must use the XFree86
copyright.  3D hardware acceleration on Linux is long overdue.  The
Mesa copyright change will allow better hardware support on Linux in
the near future.


Q2. Is it legal to change the copyright?

A2. Yes, since I (Brian Paul) hold the copyright.


Q3. I contributed code to Mesa while under the GNU copyright and don't
agree with the new copyright.  What can I do?

A3. I'll remove any such code upon request.  So far, no one has made
this request.


Q4. The XFree86 copyright allows people/companies to release binary-only
works derived from the Mesa code.  Isn't that bad?

A4. It's somewhat unfortunate, but acceptable.  However, it really is in a
company's best interest to keep modification to open-source software in the
open-source domain.  See the open-source essays written by Eric Raymond for
the reasoning.  Also note that any such concerns can be applied to the
XFree86 project as well.  It seems to be doing well.



Attention Contributors
----------------------

If you want to contribute to the Mesa project please consider the
copyright issues.  If you contribute a bug fix or new feature to
an existing component you should agree to the copyright on that
component before submitting the bug fix or feature code.

If you want to contribute a new component, such as a new device
driver or demo program, then you can put whatever copyright you want
on your code.  Insert the copyright into all files to avoid confusion.
