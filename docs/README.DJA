INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is an Allegro (DJGPP) driver for MESA. This release also includes a
"skeletal" version of GLUT for DJGPP. It was developed for the sole
purpose of compiling the sample programs. It NOT AT ALL a complete
version of GLUT!

ALL CODE IS SUBJECT TO THE MESA COPYRIGHT AGREEMENT.

REQUIRED FILES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    You will need MESA, of course. I have only tested it with version
    3.0, but it will probably work with later versions as well. It will
    NOT work with earlier versions due to major changes to the MESA
    driver interface.
    AVAILABLE AT: http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html

    You will also need DJGPP and "Allegro 3.0 + WIP". It will NOT work
    with the release version of Allegro 3.0 because I'm using some new
    features that weren't present in the first release.
    AVAILABLE AT: http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/


INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Unzip into the MESA directory, and type "make -f Makefile.dja" to
    compile all libraries and samples.

    If you get compiler (or linker) errors, make sure that you have
    "Allegro 3.0 + WIP" and that DJGPP\INCLUDE has the new allegro.h,
    and that DJGPP\LIB has the new liballeg.a.


BUGS & OTHER SHORTCOMINGS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    src/allegro/direct.h:
        Somehow the line demo (samples/line.c) only works in
        double-buffer mode. The anti-aliased lines appear fat when using
        direct mode. This is obviously a bug in direct.h - but I cannot
        find it :(

    src-glut.dja/*:
        Only the basics work - main loop and keyboard/mouse input.
        Windows, menus and fonts DO NOT WORK, and will NEVER be
        implemented (at least not by me). This version of GLUT was only
        created to allow the MESA sample programs to compile.

    include/GL/glut.h:
        This file clashes with the REAL glut.h (by Mark J. Kilgard).
        Unfortunately, you cannot have both installed at the same time.
        A backup exists (include/GL/glut_h.dja) in case you accidentally
        copy Mark's glut.h over this one.


Good Luck
