I (Brian Paul) have been given the OpenGL conformance tests (v1.1) for
the purpose of testing Mesa.  The test source code can not be disclosed.

Below are the results of testing Mesa 3.4 beta as of November 1, 2000.
The results are identical to Mesa 3.3.

The tests were run using the software X11 device driver on a 24-bit
display.

Conformance with 16-bit color buffers has improved a great deal with
Mesa 3.4.1 due to better precision in glReadPixels.  Only two tests
now fail because of dithering (buffer invariance and dithering).
This is fixed in Mesa 3.5.

Mesa's antialiased line algorithm will have to be rewritten to
pass the remaining conformance failures.  Done for Mesa 3.5.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


COVERAGE TESTS
--------------

Test that all API functions accept the spec'd parameters and reject
illegal parameters.  Results of each test is either pass or fail.

covgl test:  passed.

covglu test:  can't compile; Mesa doesn't have GLU 1.2

covglx test:  passed.

primtest:  292159 Combinations tested.  Passed.




GL CONFORMANCE TEST
===================

Render test images, read them back, then test for expected results.
