Introduction
============

While Mesa uses the OpenGL API and mimics its semantics, it is
important to understand that Mesa is not a real implementation of OpenGL
since it is not licensed.  That said, Mesa is still a viable alternative
to OpenGL.  Most OpenGL applications should run with Mesa without code
changes.

The first six years of Mesa development were done during my spare time
from August 1993 to August 1999.  Now, much of the Mesa development
work is done during my working hours with Precision Insight, Inc.

The core library was originally written on an Amiga using the DCC compiler.
Later, development was moved to an SGI workstation.  Current development
is done on PC/Linux systems.

Mesa works on most Unix workstations with ANSI C and X11.  There are also
drivers for Amiga, Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, MS DOS, NeXT, BeOS and
other systems.  Unix/X11 is still the best-supported platform.

Since the OpenGL API is used, OpenGL documentation can serve as the
documentation for Mesa's core functions.  Visit http://www.opengl.org/
for extensive OpenGL information.

The primary design goal of this library has been correctness.  Performance
has been a secondary (but still very important!) priority.  At this point,
most common rendering operations have been optimized a great deal.
However, if you find an obscure code path that isn't as fast as you
think it could be (like glDrawPixels with lookup tables and a crazy
blend mode) send a note to the author; it might not be hard to improve
the path.  Better yet, try optimizing that path yourself and send a patch.



Getting the software
====================

Mesa can be downloaded from
http://sourceforge.net/project/filelist.php?group_id=3 or from
http://www.mesa3d.org/

Since version 2.3, Mesa is distributed in two pieces:  main library code
and demos.  If you're upgrading from a previous version of Mesa or you're not
interested in the demos you can just download the core Mesa archive file.

Mesa is available in at least three archive formats:

1. GNU zip/tar

	Download MesaLib-3.4.2.tar.gz and optionally MesaDemos-3.4.2.tar.gz
	Unpack with:
		gzcat MesaLib-3.4.2.tar.gz | tar xf -
		gzcat MesaDemos-3.4.2.tar.gz | tar xf -
	or
		gunzip MesaLib-3.4.2.tar.gz ; tar xf MesaLib-3.4.2.tar
		gunzip MesaDemos-3.4.2.tar.gz ; tar xf MesaLib-3.4.2.tar
	or
		tar zxf MesaLib-3.4.2.tar.gz
		tar zxf MesaDemos-3.4.2.tar.gz

	If you don't have gzcat try zcat instead.

2. Unix compressed/tar

	Download MesaLib-3.4.2.tar.Z and optionally MesaDemos-3.4.2.tar.Z
	Unpack with:
		zcat MesaLib-3.4.2.tar.Z | tar xf -

Compiling and Installation
==========================

See the INSTALL file for instructions.



Using the Library
=================

Performance tips for software rendering:
   1. Turn off smooth shading when you don't need it (glShadeModel)
   2. Turn off depth buffering when you don't need it.
   3. Turn off dithering when not needed.
   4. Use double buffering as it's often faster than single buffering
   5. Compile in the X Shared Memory extension option if it's supported
      on your system by adding -DSHM to CFLAGS and -lXext to XLIBS for
      your system in the Make-config file.
   6. Recompile Mesa with more optimization if possible.
   7. Try to maximize the amount of drawing done between glBegin/glEnd pairs.
   8. Use the MESA_BACK_BUFFER variable to find best performance in double
      buffered mode.  (X users only)
   9. Optimized polygon rasterizers are employed when:
         rendering into back buffer which is an XImage
         RGB mode, not grayscale, not monochrome
         depth buffering is GL_LESS, or disabled
         flat or smooth shading
         dithered or non-dithered
         no other rasterization operations enabled (blending, stencil, etc)
  10. Optimized line drawing is employed when:
         rendering into back buffer which is an XImage
         RGB mode, not grayscale, not monochrome
         depth buffering is GL_LESS or disabled
         flat shading
         dithered or non-dithered
         no other rasterization operations enabled (blending, stencil, etc)
  11. Textured polygons are fastest when:
         using a 3-component (RGB), 2-D texture
         minification and magnification filters are GL_NEAREST
         texture coordinate wrap modes for S and T are GL_REPEAT
         GL_DECAL environment mode
         glHint( GL_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT, GL_FASTEST )
         depth buffering is GL_LESS or disabled
  12. Lighting is fastest when:
         Two-sided lighting is disabled
         GL_LIGHT_MODEL_LOCAL_VIEWER is false
         GL_COLOR_MATERIAL is disabled
         No spot lights are used (all GL_SPOT_CUTOFFs are 180.0)
         No local lights are used (all position W's are 0.0)
         All material and light coefficients are >= zero
  13. XFree86 users:  if you want to use 24-bit color try starting your
      X server in 32-bit per pixel mode for better performance.  That is,
      start your X server with
         startx -- -bpp 32
      instead of
         startx -- -bpp 24
  14. Try disabling dithering with the MESA_NO_DITHER environment variable.
      If this env var is defined Mesa will disable dithering and the
      command glEnable(GL_DITHER) will be ignored.


Debugging:
   Normally Mesa records but does not notify the user of errors.  It is up
   to the application to call glGetError to check for errors.  Mesa supports
   an environment variable, MESA_DEBUG, to help with debugging.  If MESA_DEBUG
   is defined, a message will be printed to stdout whenever an error occurs.

   More extensive error checking is done when Mesa is compiled with the
   DEBUG symbol defined.  You'll have to edit the Make-config file and
   add -DDEBUG to the CFLAGS line for your system configuration.  You may
   also want to replace any optimization flags with the -g flag so you can
   use your debugger.  After you've edited Make-config type 'make clean'
   before recompiling.

   In your debugger you can set a breakpoint in gl_error() to trap Mesa
   errors.

   There is a display list printing/debugging facility.  See the end of
   src/dlist.c for details.


Fortran bindings:
   Fortan bindings are no longer included with Mesa.  William F. Mitchell
   (william.mitchell@nist.gov) has developed a new set of Mesa/OpenGL and
   GLUT bindings for Fortran.  See http://math.nist.gov/f90gl for more
   information.


Off-screen rendering:
   Mesa 1.2.4 introduced off-screen rendering, a facility for generating
   3-D imagery without having to open a window on your display.  Mesa's
   simple off-screen rendering interface is completely operating system
   and window system independent so programs which use off-screen rendering
   should be very portable.  This new feature effectively enables you to
   use Mesa as an off-line, batch-oriented renderer.

   The "OSMesa" API provides 3 functions for making off-screen renderings:
   OSMesaCreateContext(), OSMesaMakeCurrent(), and OSMesaDestroyContext().
   See the Mesa/include/GL/osmesa.h header for more information.  See the
   demos/osdemo.c file for an example program.   There is no facility for
   writing images to files.

   If you want to generate large images (larger than 1280x1024) you'll
   have to edit the src/config.h file to change MAX_WIDTH and MAX_HEIGHT
   then recompile Mesa.  Image size should only be limited by available
   memory.


Profiling (may no longer work in Mesa 3.1 or later, sorry):
   Mesa 1.2.6 introduced a simple profiling facility.  It counts and
   measures the time spent in a number of important rendering operations
   and prints the information in a report before your program exits.

   By default, profiling is disabled.  To enable it, add -DPROFILE to
   the appropriate CFLAGS entry in the Make-config file, then recompile
   Mesa.  In general, you should only enable profiling during program
   development to gain insight into Mesa's performance.  Mesa runs a bit
   slower when profiling is enabled because it requires frequent polling
   of the system clock.

   The profiling report will be printed when glXDestroyContext is called
   _if_ the MESA_PROFILE environment variable is set.  You must be sure
   glXDestroyContext is called before exiting to get the profile report.
   The report will be printed to stdout and includes:

      glBegin/glEnd - number of glBegin/glEnd pairs called, total time,
         and rate in pairs/second.
      vertexes transformed - number of vertices transformed, lit, clip-
         tested, fogged, and mapped to window coordinates, total time,
         and rate in vertexes/second.
      points rasterized - number of points drawn, time, and rate.
      lines rasterized - number of lines drawn, time, and rate.
      polygons rasterized - number of polygons drawn, time and rate.
      overhead - time between glBegin/glEnd not accounted for by vertexes,
         points, lines, and polygons.  This is time spent executing
         glVertex, glNormal, glColor, etc, clipping, primitive assembly,
         and user code between glBegin/glEnd.
      glClear - number of glClears executed, total time and clears/second.
      SwapBuffers - number of swaps executed, total time and swaps/second.

   Note that the real point, line, and polygon rates should be computed by
      adding in the vertex transformation and overhead time factors.


Extensions:
   Mesa supports quite a few OpenGL extensions.  The set of available
   extensions depends on the device driver you're using.  Run the glinfo
   program to learn which extensions are available on your computer.

   There are a few Mesa-specific extensions:

   GL_MESA_window_pos

      This extension adds the glWindowPos*MESA() functions.  These functions
      are convenient alternatives to glRasterPos*() because they set the
      current raster position to a specific window coordinate, bypassing the
      usual modelview, projection and viewport transformations.  This is
      especially useful for setting the position for glDrawPixels() or
      glBitmap() to a specific window coordinate.

      See the docs/MESA_window_pos.spec file for details.

   GL_MESA_resize_buffers

      This extension adds the glResizeBuffersMESA() function.  When this
      function is called, Mesa checks if the color buffer (window) has
      been resized.  If it has, Mesa reallocates the ancillary (depth,
      stencil, accum) buffers.

      Normally, Mesa checks for window size changes whenever glViewport()
      is called.  In some applications it may not be appropriate to call
      glViewport() when the window is resized.  Such applications should
      call glResizeBuffersMESA() instead so the ancillary buffers are
      correctly updated.

      See the docs/MESA_resize_buffers.spec file for more details.
      This extension is new in version 2.2.

Why is it the library called Mesa?
==================================

Why not?  More obvious names were considered but had to be rejected:
FreeGL (too similar to the trademarked name OpenGL), Free3D (too similar
to DEC's Open3D).  Also, I'm tired of acronyms.



Contributors
============

Many people have contributed to Mesa.  I really appreciate the help!
See the Mesa web site for a list of past and current contributors.

If you want to help with Mesa, first join the Mesa developer's
mailing list.  Then post a message explaining what you might like
to help with.  The Mesa web page has a list of a few work items
which you may consider.

Anyone is welcome to contribute code to the Mesa project, provided you
agree to the copyright terms of the relevant code.  See the COPYRIGHT
file.

If you're contribution code to the Mesa library itself:
   1. Try to write clean code (uniform indentation, comments, meaningful
      identifiers, etc).  It must be readable and maintainable!
   2. Test your code.  On several occations I've incorporated code from
      users which later turned out to have bugs.  Now, I'm pretty hesitant
      to use code which doesn't look good.
