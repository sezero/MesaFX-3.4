Mesa 2.2 MSDOS Port Revision 0.9.1
----------------------------------

I`ve setup an ftp site to get the latest versions of mesa msdos
its at 206.103.168.10 login mesa password mesa
rememberr though those are likely to be beta/alpha versions,
the one you get from brian paul`s homepage is the release version.

I`ll stick dmake.exe (3.80) there too..

Watcom C Build Instructions ----------------------------------------------------

To compile with Watcom C 10.x do in each of
mesa/src mesa/src-tk mesa/src-aux mesa/src-glu do this

make sure you have a \etc\startup.mk, i`ve supplied mine in
case you need it, watch you don`t overwrite your own.

dmake -f makefile.dos

Demos can be built with the mesados.bat use, edit the mesados.bat first
and make any changes for your system !

mesados <demo_name>

eg. mesados wave

will build wave.exe

DJGPP Build Instructions -------------------------------------------------------

To compile the libs, demos, and samples with DJGPP do:

make -f makefile.dj


VESA Instructions --------------------------------------------------------------

To use the VESA support you *need* to get hold of Scitechs SuperVGA KIT library
from http://wwww.scitechsoft.com, also make sure you remove the # from the
#CFLAGS += UNIVBE in the src/makefile.dos line, I`m more than sure i can`t
distribute the files required with DOS Mesa. Its a very good library and makes
VESA intergration very easy.

Currently the DJGPP version has no VESA support. I`m working on it, djgpp
has some really bad tools, ld is very poor add a.out support back !.

Some of the demos won`t build out of the box as they use near and far as
variable names, which are reserved words on DOS compilers. Some other
demos use unix style time() functions which some dos compilers don`t support.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I use dmake because wmake, make and nmake all suck big time, dmake
is excellent and is unix friendly. I`ll send the .exe to anyone
who wants it, or make it available at my website..

I use Denis Vadura`s Dmake 3.80PL

If anyone hassles me enough i might rewrite the makefiles for wmake at
least.

A couple of the demos don`t work yet....

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things I (or some kind soul) need to do..

Change the key handler, i have a keyboard interrupt already made just
needs integration. (the one in there is really poor and is temporary)

The RGB mode is really a 256 colour mode, it allocates the first 256
colours used. then tries to map them to others allocated later. Currently
it isn`t that good, its difficult to make up a palette that will effectively
work for all situations, its not really effective at the moment.

General improvements.

GLX support.

Does anyone really want mode13 support ? Do i need to fix up the RGB
mode of 320x200x256 ? email me at cwallace@dreamworks.com and nag me
or any other wishlist stuff for modes.

Better Glide support, thanks to brian bruning and gary mctaggart
at 3dfx for the dual board and the support.

Change Scitech SuperVGA KIT to MGL ( thanks to tom and kendall at scitech for
sending me a copy )

MsVC support.

Figure out a way of guessing the resolution , I`m more than likely
going to change the way it works, so that it first tries for 3DFX,
then Vesa, then mode13.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long Live OpenGL(tm) and kudos to brian paul for Mesa.
